# Applications API Reference   

The Paysafe Applications API allows Paysafe's Platform Partners to create their own white-labeled merchant onboarding experience, via a single API call. 

The new API simplifies the entire merchant onboarding process and performs underwriting checks as needed. Once a merchant application is received, Paysafe will quickly enable the merchant to accept payments using the selected payment method(s).

# Prerequisites
<a name="prereq" title="Prerequisites"></a>

Below are the prerequisite steps for merchant onboarding:  

1. The partner must contact the account manager to set up the account.
2. Once the account is set up, the partner will get the Onboarding Config ID from the Paysafe integrations team. 
3. Paysafe integrations team will also provide authentication credentials to the partner.

# Authentication 

To use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set up its system for you 
and then provide an API key. Your API key looks something like this:
 * Key ID – PartnerXYZ
 * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. Combine the Key ID and Key Password into a string separated by a colon, for example: “Key ID:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (that is, “Basic”) are added before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key ID and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

`Authorization: Basic
UGFydG5lclhZWjpCLXRzdDEtMC01MWVkMzllNC0zMTJkMDIzNDVkM2YxMjMxMjA4ODFkZmY5YmI0MDIwYTg5ZThhYzQ0Y2RmZGNlY2Q3MDIxNTExODJmZGM5NTIyNzI2NjFkMjkwYWIyZTU4NDllMzFiYjAzZGVlZGU3ZQ==`

For additional details, refer to [Authentication](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/reference-information/important-integration-concepts/authentication/).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that they are used appropriately for your needs.

# Getting Started

Click [here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/platforms/applications-api/typical-api-calls/) for details of some common scenarios for on-boarding merchants with the Applications API.

# Testing Instructions

Test accounts enable you to process API transactions that mirror the functionality of the Production environment. 
It is important to make sure that your systems are working correctly before going into a Live environment. 

With the Applications API, you can:

* Verify the lengths and formats for all attributes you send.
* Verify support for all the operation types that you require.
* Review all common errors as well as errors that may occur for each operation.


For access to Test accounts and credentials, contact your account manager or reach out to <integrations@paysafe.com>. 

###  Test URL
To test your integration with Paysafe, use the following Test URL:

`https://api.test.paysafe.com/merchant/v1/`

For example:

`https://api.test.paysafe.com/merchant/v1/applications`

Click [here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/platforms/applications-api/using-the-api) for details on using the Test environment.

# Going Live
 
Once you are satisfied with your integration to the Test environment, you must repeat the configuration changes made to your Test account in your Production account.

> **Note:** You cannot use your Test credentials to process transaction requests in the Production environment.

### Go Live Checklist
1. You must have a production account and an Onboarding Config ID for your production account.
2. You must have the API Keys for the production environment.
3. You must use the Production URL for your API calls.
4. You must have [Webhooks](#webhooks) configured for all the events. **Note:** Configuring Webhooks is optional.

**Note:** For items 1, 2, & 3, reach out to your account manager or <integrations@paysafe.com> for any issues.


### Production URL
To process live requests with Paysafe, use the following Production URL:

`https://api.paysafe.com/merchant/v1/`

For example:

`https://api.paysafe.com/merchant/v1/applications`

<a name="globalinvalidcharacters" title="Global Invalid Characters"></a>
# Global Invalid Characters

You must not include any of the characters in this [table](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/global-invalid-characters/) as values in any of your request parameters. If you do, your request will result in an error.

<a name="isostandards" title="ISO Standards"></a>
# ISO Standards

ISO standards add value by providing the common business process data semantics to be used in the API based exchanges. This [section](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/iso-standards/) presents you codes for four areas - Currency, Province, State, and Country. 


<a name="webhooks" title="Webhooks"></a>
# Webhooks

A Webhook is an HTTP callback that is triggered when an event takes place. To configure your webhooks, get in touch with your account manager or reach us at <integrations@paysafe.com>.

> **Note:** To receive webhooks from Paysafe, you must create a callback URL to receive the webhook that is triggered. 
You are responsible for ensuring its continued availability.

## Webhooks Signature

The webhook notification contains a signature header calculated using the following algorithm:

```
digest = HMAC_SHA256 (hmacKey, UTF 8 string containing the JSON webhook request body)

signature = base 64 (digest)
```

The code receiving the webhook needs to repeat this algorithm and compare the value generated with the value received in the header.

Example Header:

```
Signature: UMaQ4h635wUc4hp60Z5ASBC/5UtqKybAldOkLv6ngc0=
```

## Some Notes on Webhooks

+ When the status of one of your application requests change, Paysafe immediately sends a callback to your webhook's endpoint URL to inform you of the status change. 
+ Paysafe expects an HTTP status of 200 OK or 202 ACCEPTED from your endpoint as an acknowledgement. In case any other HTTP status code is received, Paysafe assumes you have not received the webhook, and attempts to resend it.
+ If Paysafe does not get an acknowledgment (200 or 202), it makes a maximum of two additional attempts (total three attempts) to send a callback to that URL.
+ As Paysafe does not have a notification method to alert you when callbacks are not reaching your endpoint URL, you should ensure continued availability of your endpoint.
+ All endpoint URLs should use HTTPS/SSL to ensure security. Note that only the default **HTTPS port 443** is supported.
+ You must ignore the duplicate notifications for an already processed event. It is recommended to make the notification URL endpoints idempotent.

<a name="merchantlocationrequest" title="Create an new location"></a>

Click **Create an Application for a New Location** above to see an example of how to create an application for a new location:

* This is how you add a new LOCATION to an already existing merchant account. To add a new LOCATION to a merchant account, the parameter *type* should be *ADDITIONAL_LOCATION*. Location here refers to a website. For instance, as a merchant you use this when you plan to integrate Paysafe's payment method in one of your new websites. 

For more information on other common objects used, refer to the section [Complex JSON Objects](#accountobject). To know how to submit a merchant application, refer to the section [Submit Merchant Application](submitapplication)
